Purpose
-------
This Ruby app is an investment research tool that aims to eliminate the need for expensive services like Bloomberg and Capital IQ, which can cost between $1,000 - $2,000 per month.  Most of the information that an investment analyst needs exists in the public domain, like the SEC's EDGAR website.  This app will allow the user to call upon a company, either by name or by ticker, and the specific financial data on the company that he seeks.  Data from the income statement, balance sheet or cash flow statement - from either 10-Qs or 10-Ks - will be the primary source of the data.


Project Status
--------------
Everything is preliminary - pure planning stage right now


Features
--------
Input company ticker, financial metric and time period, and the app will return the data that is sought.


Bugs
----
Yeah, surely there will be some, but over time we will work them out.
